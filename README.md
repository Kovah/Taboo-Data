# Taboo-Data

![Current version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/kovah/taboo-data.svg) ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/taboo-data.svg) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/kovah/taboo-data.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Kovah/Taboo-Data) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kovah/Taboo-Data.svg)

A data set for Taboo games. Plain JSON files which contain the keyword, and some buzzwords like in the 
original Taboo game.


### Data Structure

All lists are structured by using a key > value based approach. This means that the array keys contain
the keyword like `BÃ¤r` and the array values contain the buzzwords, like `Grizzly, Honig, Pooh`.

Instead of having to parse all entries like before, you can now decode the whole file contents and directly
use all entries out of the box.


## Usage

You can use the data set by [downloading it](https://github.com/Kovah/Taboo-Data/archive/master.zip)
or use one of the following methods:

**Javascript**

```
npm install taboo-data
or
yarn add taboo-data
```

Here's an example on how to use the package with Javascript:

```javascript
import { TabooData } from 'taboo-data';

const categories = TabooData.categories();
const animals = TabooData.getCategory('animals');
```

Please notice that importing the whole TabooData dataset will bloat your Javascript files as all entries from all
categories are loaded.
To import single categories manually or asynchronously, you can call them on their own:

```javascript
import * as cars from 'taboo-data/src/data/de/cars';

const data = cars;
```


**PHP**

```
composer require kovah/taboo-data
```

Here's an example on how to use the package with Javascript:

```php
<?php
use Kovah\TabooData;

$categories = TabooData::getCategories();
$cars = TabooData::getCategory('cars');
```
